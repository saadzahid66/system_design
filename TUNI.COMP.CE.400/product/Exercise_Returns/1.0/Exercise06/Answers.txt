1. Did you get similar results simulating Kvazaar on ARM? What was the simulated FPS for Kvazaar on ARM?

	No, the simulated FPS is much higher than it really was on ARM. The simulated FPS for Kvazaar on ARM was 1911.42.

2. What were your values for delay_c, search_intra_rough_percentage_c, rest_percentage_c?

	delay_c = 2800
	search_intra_rough_percentage_c = 60 %
	rest_percentage_c = 98 % - 60 % = 38 %

3. What was the simulated FPS of the HW-accelerated version?

	The simulated FPS of the HW-accelerated version was 1.33.

4. How was the computation time/delay added to the simulation on both ARM simulation and HW-accelerated simulation? What function/s, variable/s, and calculations are used?

	The computation delay was added to the simulation with a function delay that is called during the encoding.

	There are 2 of them. The first one is search_intra_rough_delay. It is used with the variable search_intra_rough_percentage_c. The other one is search_delay and it is used with the rest_percentage_c variable. Both of these functions used the variable delay_c and called the generic function delay_ns. This function just do a some of the actual time and the delay.

5. Do you think the computation time/delay is calculated accurately enough?

	Yes
		
6. How do we know the improvement we got with the HW accelerator is correct?

	

7. How many data transfers happened and how much data was sent and read while simulating the HW-accelerated version?
